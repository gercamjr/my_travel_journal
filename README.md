# My Personal Travel Journal created with React and SwiperJS
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this project as part of the 'Learn React Course' on Scrimba.

I learned to dynamically create components from pre-existing data. Also infused a little bit of SwiperJS to create the sliding animations.
